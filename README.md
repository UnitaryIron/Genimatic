# Genimatic

Genimatic is a lightweight, mobile-first web application for generating AI-powered images from text prompts.  
It is powered by the [Pollinations API](https://image.pollinations.ai/), offering high-quality results in a variety of visual styles with zero backend infrastructure.  
The application runs entirely in the browser using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring fast load times and compatibility across devices.

## How It Works

Genimatic interacts directly with the **Pollinations API** using `fetch()` requests.  
When a user enters a prompt and selects a style:

1. The app sends a request to:
   https://image.pollinations.ai/prompt/{encodedPrompt}
   with optional style parameters appended to the prompt.

2. The API processes the request and returns a generated image.

3. The image is displayed in the UI, added to the local gallery, and made available for download or sharing.

The app leverages:
- **`localStorage`** for persisting images and prompt history.
- **CSS Grid/Flexbox** for responsive layout.
- **Vanilla JavaScript** for event handling, API calls, and DOM manipulation.

## Usage Guide

1. **Enter a Prompt**  
   Type a descriptive phrase into the input box.  
   Example:
   a futuristic city skyline at sunset, ultra realistic

2. **Select a Style**  
Choose your preferred style from the style selector (e.g., Realistic, Anime, Fantasy).

3. **Generate**  
Click the **Generate** button. The AI will create and display your image in seconds.

4. **Interact with the Image**  
- **Download** the image in `.png` format.
- **Copy Link** to share directly.
- **Remix** to re-generate with modifications.
- **Upscale** for higher resolution (if supported).

5. **Gallery**  
Access previously generated images via the gallery tab. Images are stored locally and persist between sessions.
